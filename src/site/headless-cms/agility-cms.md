Agility CMS
Agility CMS is a Canadian-based headless content management system (CMS) designed for speed, flexibility, and scalability. Built with a content-first approach, Agility CMS empowers businesses to create, manage, and deliver digital experiences across multiple platforms with ease.

Content teams enjoy full control over page creation, layout management, and content development thanks to Web Studio, the visual interface that lets users make and view edits in real-time. Development teams can build with freedom using Agility CMSâ€™s nearly limitless framework, DevOps, and front-end integration capabilities.

Agility CMS Has Web Studio
Web Studio is an elevated experience that allows users to preview and manage content in real-time, without ever leaving the platform. It's the tool CMS Critic says is "...a heckuva lot more than just a WYSIWYG editor. The entire experience feels intuitive, lightweight, and easy to navigate...while providing easy access to all the essential tooling."

Architecture
Agility has APIs for everything. Use the REST API or our sync SDK (or both) to interact with your content.
Code it your way. Use one of our starter templates to bootstrap development, or use your own.
Build what you want, how you want. Server-rendered websites. Single-page apps. Statically-generated websites. Your options are nearly limitless.
No database required. Agility CMS hosts and completely abstracts away your database so you never have to worry about maintenance, backups, or connection strings ever again.
